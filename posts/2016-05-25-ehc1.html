<h3 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a> is a purely functional programming language. It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">generic language</a>, meaning, it’s not domain specific.<br />
It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional</a>, as functions are treated as first class values.<br />
It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional">purely functional</a>, as it excludes destructive modifications, like mutability.</p>
<h4 id="first-class-values.">First class values.</h4>
<p>So, what does a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_value">first class value</a> mean?<br />
First of all, what is a value? A value is anything that can be represented in the computer’s memory. A value ,for example, can be a number, a string, a date, but not necessarely just those. A programming language then defines a way to compute and work with these values, printing them to the screen, or adding them together, in case of numbers. So a first class value is simply something that we can pass as an argument, return from a function, or assign to a variable. In a functional language then, a function can be assigned to a variable, for a later computation, or passed to another function as a parameter, to implement a more generic code.</p>
<h4 id="functions">Functions</h4>
<p>The most general definition of a function is a mapping between two sets. A set is just a collection of elements, provided that no element is present multiple times.</p>
<p>Examples of a set would be</p>
<pre><code>A = {1,2,3}
B = {z,y,x}
C = {0}
D = {} (empty set)</code></pre>
<p>but not these ones, as elements are not unique in the set.</p>
<pre><code>E = {1,1,2}
F = {z,y,z}</code></pre>
<p>For example, a function f mapping from set A to B, would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>f(1) = z
f(2) = y
f(3) = x</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Or g:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>g(1) = z
g(2) = z
g(3) = z</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Or h:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>h(1) = z</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>h is also called a <strong>partial</strong> function, as it doesn’t define the mapping for each element from A to B, while f and g, that do, are called <strong>total</strong> functions.</p>
<p>Another way of defining functions is by defining an expression to compute, like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>f(x) = x + 1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>f(x) is the <em>head</em> of the function, <em>x</em> is an argument of the function, while <em>x+1</em> is the body of the function.<br />
This allows to map for every input, a return value computed by the expression defined.</p>
<p>So, when that gets applied for each member of the set A, it becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>f(1) = 2
f(2) = 3
f(3) = 4</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or also</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>f(1) = 1 + 1
f(2) = 2 + 1
f(3) = 3 + 1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And the two definitions are not distinguishable, as they have the same behaviour.<br />
And this brings us to the main point of this lesson.</p>
<h3 id="lambda-calculus.">Lambda Calculus.</h3>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Wikipedia</a>:<br />
<em>Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.</em></p>
<p>So uh, that’s a lot. But basically it’s just <em>formal way of defining these computations</em>. We’ll see those abstractions and applications in the following paragraphs, don’t worry.</p>
<h4 id="exercises">Exercises:</h4>
<p>Reduce these expressions to normal form.</p>
<pre><code> (\z -&gt; z) (\y -&gt; y y) (\x -&gt; x a)

 (\x -&gt; (\y -&gt;  x y y)) (\a -&gt; a) b

 (\x -&gt; x x) (\y -&gt; y x) z</code></pre>
