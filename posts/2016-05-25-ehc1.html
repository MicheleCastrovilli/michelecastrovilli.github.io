<h2 id="intro-to-haskell-and-functional-programming-and-lambda-calculus.">Intro to Haskell and functional programming, and lambda calculus.</h2>
<h3 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h3>
<p>Haskell is a purely functional programming language. It’s a generic language, meaning, it’s not domain specific.<br />
It’s functional, as functions are treated as first class values.<br />
It’s pure, as it’s based purely on the concept of the lambda calculus, without breaking it, to allow for IO.</p>
<h4 id="first-class-values.">First class values.</h4>
<p>So, what does first class value mean?<br />
First of all, what is a value?<br />
A programming language defines a way to compute “values”, and work with them, being numbers, strings, dates. In case of numbers for example, we can add them, and strings print them to screen. So a first class value, is just something that we can work with directly in the language, and in functional ones, it means we can also consider functions like this.</p>
<h4 id="functions">Functions</h4>
<p>The most general definition of a function is a mapping between two sets. A set is just a collection of elements, provided that no element is present multiple times.</p>
<p>Examples of a set would be</p>
<pre><code>A = {1,2,3}
B = {z,y,x}
C = {0}
D = {} (empty set)</code></pre>
<p>but not</p>
<pre><code>E = {1,1,2}
F = {z,y,z}</code></pre>
<p>For example, a function f mapping from set A to B, would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>f(1) = z
f(2) = y
f(3) = x</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Or g:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>g(1) = z
g(2) = z
g(3) = z</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Or h:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>h(1) = z</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>h is also called a <strong>partial</strong> function, as it doesn’t define the mapping for each element from A to B, while f and g, that do, are called <strong>total</strong> functions.</p>
<p>Another way of defining functions is by defining an expression, like so</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>f(x) = x + 1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And that “x” is an argument to the function, while “x+1” is the body of the function.<br />
So, when that gets applied for each member of the set A, it becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>f(1) = 2
f(2) = 3
f(3) = 4</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or also</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>f(1) = 1 + 1
f(2) = 2 + 1
f(3) = 3 + 1</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And the two definitions are not distinguishable, as they have the same behaviour.<br />
And this brings us to the main point of this lesson.</p>
<h3 id="lambda-calculus.">Lambda Calculus.</h3>
<p>From wikipedia: Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.</p>
<p>So uh, that’s a lot. But basically it’s just <em>formal way of defining these computations</em>. We’ll see those abstractions and applications in the following paragraphs, don’t worry.</p>
<p>Exercises :</p>
<p>Reduce these expressions to normal form.</p>
<pre><code> (\z -&gt; z) (\y -&gt; y y )  (\x -&gt; x a)

 (\x -&gt; (\y -&gt;  x y y )) (\a -&gt; a ) b

 (\x -&gt; x x) (\y -&gt; y x) z</code></pre>
